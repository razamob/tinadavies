# Command line instructions:

1. Run npm install for frontend folder and backend folder
2. Run npm run dev in backend folder to run server
3. Run npm start in frontend folder to run application
4. Backend api can be tested with tool such as Postman

# Assumptions
1. For the UI - There's no component for creating entries. Assumed entry would be done by hitting the endpoint as a service.
2. I separated the sort feature into its own component and each card as a component
3. Frontend works, backend works, websocket is not fully implemented.
